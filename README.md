# LinuxED
Installer for EnhancedDiscord that works on Linux. The one provided by EnhancedDiscord does not work on Linux, and I was bored when making this. This project is not affiliated with Discord, or EnhancedDiscord in any way. I made this out of boredom and to see how good of something I could make in Python, so please note that I am still learning and that this is poorly coded.
# Requirements
This only requires git and python3.  
To install git on Debian or any Debian derivatives (Ubuntu, Linux Mint) do `sudo apt install git`  
To install git on Arch Linux or any Arch Linux derivatives (Manjaro, Antergos) do `sudo pacman -S git`  
To install git on Solus, do `sudo eopkg install git`
# Installation
Installation is simple, just open a terminal in your desired LinuxED directory, and do `git clone https://github.com/Cr3atable/LinuxED/` then CD into that directory by doing `cd LinuxED` to get to the LinuxED files.
# Usage
Simply go into your LinuxED directory (`cd LinuxED`) and do `python3 LinuxED.py` to start it up. Then follow all prompts.
