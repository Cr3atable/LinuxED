# LinuxED
Installer for EnhancedDiscord that works on Linux. The one provided by EnhancedDiscord does not work on Linux, and I was bored when making this. This project is not affiliated with Discord, or EnhancedDiscord in any way. I made this out of boredom and to see how good of something I could make in Python, so please note that I am still learning and that this is poorly coded, and I'm aware of how messy, inconsistent, and idiotic this script looks.
# Operating systems supported
LinuxED supports most major distributions of Linux, MacOS, and even Windows.  
It also supports all versions of Discord (PTB, Stable, Canary, etc.)
# Features
- Custom index.js location
- EnhancedDiscord updater (this does update ED)
- LinuxED updater (this does not update ED, it updates the LinuxED script)
- Automates all EnhancedDiscord installation on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
# Requirements
This only requires Python3.  

You will need Python's distutils, which most commonly has the package name `python3-distutils`  
To install Python's distutils on Debian or any Debian derivatives (Ubuntu, Linux Mint) do `sudo apt install python3-distutils`

# Installation and Usage
