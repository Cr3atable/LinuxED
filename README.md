# LinuxED
Installer for EnhancedDiscord that works on Linux. The one provided by EnhancedDiscord does not work on Linux, and I was bored when making this. This project is not affiliated with Discord, or EnhancedDiscord in any way. I made this out of boredom and to see how good of something I could make in Python, so please note that I am still learning and that this is poorly coded, and I'm aware of how messy, inconsistent, and idiotic this script looks.
# Versions of Discord supported
LinuxED supports:
Discord stable, Flatpak Discord, Snap Discord, Discord Canary, and Discord PTB.
# Features
- Custom index.js location
- LinuxED updater (this does not update ED, it updates the LinuxED script)
- Optional BetterDiscord support
- Automates all EnhancedDiscord installation on Linux.
# Requirements
